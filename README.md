# IMDB_Pyspark_Analysis

Purpose of this course project was to leverage my understanding of cloud computing services such as AWS EMR and Pyspark SQL library to visualize/analyze datasets that are too large for pandas. 

Project also involves descriptive EDA and answering a few questions of interest while looking at attributes such as titles, actors, genres, and other categories while drilling up and down on 4 spark dataframes. In the notebook, leverage EMR clusters and attach a Pyspark kernel. Pandas version 1.0.5 and matplotlib version 3.2.1.
